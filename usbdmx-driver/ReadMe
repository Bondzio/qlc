This driver and source code for test applications is provided as is.
In case of trouble with compiling, contact driver@lighting-solutions.de.
In case of trouble with packaging, contact hjunnila@users.sf.net.

The makefile contains stuff to build the module only for 2.6.x kernels.
There are two ways to install this driver:

1: DEBIAN PACKAGE
   If you want to create a debian package, type:
	dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

   And to install the package, go to the parent directory and type:
	dpkg -i usbdmx-driver_2.1-1_i386.deb

2: MANUAL INSTALLATION
   If you want to install the driver manually, type:
	make
	su -c "make install"

   You might need to run "depmod -a" as root after installation to 
   update your module information. Otherwise you need to reboot your 
   machine.

Both methods attempt to install a .rules file into /etc/udev/rules.d/,
which should enable any user to read/write to all (found) /dev/usbdmx* files.

The driver uses major 180, minor 192+. To create the devices used to access
the interfaces manually, type as root:

	mknod /dev/usbdmx0 c 180 192
	mknod /dev/usbdmx1 c 180 193
	mknod /dev/usbdmx2 c 180 194
	...and so forth

The driver supports up to 16 devices in the moment.
To load the driver manually (without installing it), type:

	insmod usbdmx.ko

USAGE:
For advanced usage information (in your own code) consult the demo 
source code demo.c and the include file "usbdmx.h".
